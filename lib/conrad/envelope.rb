module Conrad
  # Processor class used to take a given event, extract a set of attributes from
  # it, then wrap the remaining attributes into a payload attribute. This allows
  # downstream consumers to know about the outermost structure (the envelope)
  # without needing to account for all possible permutations of the event. This
  # also allows routing through various systems on a small number of values. If
  # a given envelope key does not exist in the original event, then it will be
  # set to nil in the resulting event.
  #
  # When using this processor, it is highly recommended that this be the last
  # processor unless you need to act on the wrapped event.

    #   and Symbols should not be considered interchangeable, and the event
    #   must be created with the attribute keys matching the types given here)
